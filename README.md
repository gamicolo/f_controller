# Fuzzy control project

Project of a fuzzy controller in order to get the postgrade title of System Control Specialist. This is the code that runs on a Arduino Uno board. The GUI is
located in the repo: 

https://github.com/gamicolo/python_fuzzy_gui

This controller uses the fuzzy logic techniques to control the temperature of a small chamber. 

The fuzzy logic technique is a innovative technology used in the design of solutions for multiparametric and no lineal control models. The control systems
implemented with fuzzy logic offers a more quickly solution compared with conventional techniques, but in the other hand they are tied to the expirience of
the operator of that system
